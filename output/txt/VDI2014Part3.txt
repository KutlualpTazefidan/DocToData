ABSTRACT 
The new guideline VDI 2014 Part 3 has been released for printing in September 2006. In 
addition to a condensed presentation of general topics which are essential for the calculation 
of fibre reinforced plastics (FRP) components such as the modelling of various lamina types, 
the laminate analysis by means of netting theory and Classical Laminate Theory, elastic 
stability analyses, joints and cyclically loaded laminates the application of the new physically 
based ‘action plane’ fracture criteria of Puck is comprehensively described in the guideline. 
The Puck theory of failure in laminates is both physically correct and easy to use in design 
practice. It is based on the Coulomb-Mohr hypothesis of brittle fracture. This paper gives 
some interesting background information on this theory. 
 
1. The new guideline VDI 2014 Part 3 
Frequently, the development of components made from fibre reinforced plastics (FRP) 
takes unacceptably long time and the development costs are too high. The great variety in the 
selection of materials and laminate construction offers on the one hand quite a number of 
possible solutions, but on the other hand it increases the effort required to find an ‘optimized’ 
component design. In addition to this it is rather difficult for an engineer active in practice to 
become aware of the progress in research and to assess its relevance and practical 
applicability. Therefore, work has been going on since many years on a VDI (Verein 
Deutscher Ingenieure) guideline with the aim to facilitate the design work for FRP 
components, by providing a compilation of proven methods for FRP laminate and component 
design.  
The value of the meaningful terminology and symbols well adapted for FRP, which is 
provided in the guideline, is not to be underestimated. After some more general 
considerations on methods for the component design and information on available computer 
programs an extensive chapter dealing with the modelling of laminates follows. According to 
the recognized need in design practice macro-mechanical and phenomenological models are 
used throughout. However they cover both in quantitative and qualitative manner the 
necessary physical basis. The smallest computational element is the single lamina within the 
laminate, being reinforced by random mat, woven fabric or uni-directionally (UD) oriented 
fibres. Within the guideline, which comprises around 160 pages, one also finds advices for the 
design and analysis of several types of joints, such as bolted, loop and bonded joints. In order 
to account for the risk of failure due to the loss of elastic stability of thin walled FRP 
components, the state of the art buckling formulae are given. Cyclically loaded laminates are 
treated both in the chapter “lamina-by-lamina” fracture analysis and in a separate paragraph 
for design advices.

2. The Puck theory of failure in laminates in the guideline VDI 2014 Part 3 
A large part (about 50 pages) of the guideline [VDI06] is dedicated to the laminate failure 
theory of Puck. There is still considerable uncertainty among designers on how to assess the 
confusing amount of failure theories and degradation models for FRP. Apparently, even the 
World Wide Failure Exercise (WWFE) [Hin04] could not remove the uncertainty in this field. 
The alarmingly high divergences between the results of different theories for identical 
problems produced by the participants of the WWFE may have even increased the scepticism 
of practitioners. The computational results of the different theories have been assessed by the 
organizers of the WWFE only with regard to a comparison with the provided test results, but 
in some cases these are incomplete and a little ambiguous. This is especially true for the 
results on ‘isolated’ UD-test specimen (see for instance Figure 10 to 12 in [Puc02]) which are 
used for the judgement of failure criteria for interfibre failure, see also [Kno07]. For the 
ranking of the theories there were no considerations on the physical background of the 
theories. In order to counteract the feeling of uncertainty of practitioners, the topic ‘strength 
analysis’ has been treated in a somewhat unusual way in VDI 2014 Part 3 insofar as not only 
the procedures are described but, in some sections rather comprehensive explanations are 
given on the physical and mathematical background of the theory. 
Puck started his work on successive failure processes in GRP laminates in about 1955, 
when he and a few other enthusiastic members of the Darmstadt Technical University began 
to develop, build and fly the first sailplane with an all glass fibre/epoxy wing featuring a low 
drag laminar profile. In 1959, he became a member of the composite materials research group 
at the German Plastics Institute in Darmstadt. Before he left in 1969 for GRP industry he 
published two papers [Puc69a; Puc69b] in which he described already the general procedure 
of a non-linear lamina-by-lamina fracture analysis of laminates. Puck was obviously the first 
author, who has published the idea that fibre failure (FF) and interfibre failure (IFF) should be 
distinguished and theoretically treated by separate and independent failure criteria [Puc69a]. 
This was at that time a first, but decisive, step on the way to physically based failure criteria. 
For a physically based theoretical treatment of the successive failure process in laminates, 
the Puck theory supplies at least 4 essential topics: 
1) Non-linear stress and strain analysis before IFF 
2) Physically-based action plane related fracture criteria for IFF and FF 
3) A continuous degradation after the onset of IFF 
4) Considerations on total failure of a laminate 
 
3. Phenomenological observations on brittle fracture of UD-composites 
On a unidirectional composite element, there are 6 different types of stresses which can 
produce fracture, see Figure 1: 
• σ||-tension and σ||-compression 
• σ⊥-tension and σ⊥-compression 
• τ⊥⊥-shear 
• τ⊥||-shear

Figure 1  The basic stressings (stressing means type of stress) of a UD-composite element  
σ|| stressing is responsible for fibre failure (FF), while σ⊥, τ⊥⊥, τ⊥|| stressings cause interfibre failure 
(IFF). 
Also shown are the planes in which brittle fracture occurs (τ||⊥ can not produce a fracture of its action 
plane, because fibres would have to be sheared off. Fracture occurs much easier on the parallel to fibre 
action plane in which τ⊥|| with the same magnitude as τ||⊥ is acting). 
 
Remark: According to the terminology used in VDI 2014 Part 3 symbols for tensile stresses, stressings 
and strengths are denominated by the superscript t and those for compressive stresses, stressings and 
strengths by the superscript c. 
 
In order to characterize certain types of stress Puck introduces the concept of ‘stressing’. 
Consider for instance a σ⊥-stressing, it is quite unimportant whether we are dealing with a 
stress σ2 or σ3 stress or with a stress σn as shown in Figure 2; the decisive feature is that it is 
acting transverse (⊥) to the fibre direction. 
In accordance with the 6 stressings shown in Figure 1, also 6 corresponding strengths exist 
and they are designated as follows:

⊥ . 
It is important to note that the widely used term ‘strength’ means the experimentally 
determined ultimate load divided by the cross section of the plane, which is oriented 
perpendicularly to the applied stress. This is valid for a tensile or compressive load. If a shear 
strength has to be determined the shear load at failure is divided by the area of the plane in 
which the shear load was acting. However in case of brittle fracture behaviour of the material 
this plane is in most cases not identical with the fracture plane. When determining a strength 
value, there is normally no attention paid to the failure mode of the material which can be for 
instance extensive yielding, crushing or brittle fracture or whatever and also not to the 
orientation of a fracture plane, if such a plane would appear. 
The fracture planes which appear when a UD-composite is loaded by a given stressing until 
fracture is reached, are also shown in Figure 1. Such fractures can always be observed when 
GFRP or CFRP with a non-flexibilized thermoset matrix are tested.  
With transverse compression σ⊥
c for instance an oblique fracture plane occurs. From this 
observation we conclude that the fracture is produced mainly by shear. Also with 
transverse/transverse shear τ⊥⊥-stressing the fracture plane is inclined by about 45° against the 


 
 
Page 4 
action plane of τ⊥⊥. Obviously the appearing fracture is a cleavage fracture caused by the 
maximum principal (tensile) stress which acts on a plane inclined by 45° against the action 
plane of  τ⊥⊥.  
These observations lead to the following conclusion: Uniaxial transverse compressive 
stressing σ⊥
c causes fracture in a plane which does not coincide with the action plane of σ⊥
c. 
Also pure τ⊥⊥ causes fracture in a plane which does not have the same direction as the action 
plane of τ⊥⊥. Only the tensile σ⊥
t-stressing and the τ⊥||-stressing produce a fracture in their 
action planes, i.e. their action plane is also a fracture plane. 
 
4. Failure hypotheses based on the experimental observations 
The observations mentioned above lead to the conclusion that we are dealing with typical 
brittle fracture behaviour. Therefore, for composites of this kind which are intrinsically 
brittle it does not make sense to adopt criteria similar to the well-known ‘von Mises yield 
criterion’ for ductile metals. It seems much more reasonable to step back to the roots of brittle 
fracture theory, which means to the ideas of Coulomb and Mohr. It was around 1900 that Otto 
Mohr came up with his surprisingly simple fracture hypothesis: 
 
‘The stresses on the fracture plane are decisive for fracture’. 
 
This hypothesis is very easy to understand but it is not as easy to handle, because the 
location of the fracture plane is not known a priori. The position of the fracture plane has to 
be determined first, before the fracture stresses can be calculated using a suitable brittle 
fracture criterion which, according to the above hypothesis, has to be based on the stresses on 
the fracture plane. 
The idea of using the concept of Mohr was originally recommended by Hashin in his well-
known 1980 paper [Has80] but he did not further pursue this idea. Puck tackled the task of 
modifying the Coulomb-Mohr Theory for the application on UD-composites in 1992.  
Puck’s fracture hypothesis adapted to a UD-composite element reads as follows: 
 
The normal stress σσσσn and the shear stress ττττnt and ττττn1 on the fracture plane (see 
Figure 2) are decisive for Interfibre Fracture (IFF). 
A tensile stress σσσσn supports the fracture, while in contrast a compressive stress ‘makes 
the material stronger’. In other words: A compressive σn impedes the IFF brought about by 
the shear stresses τnt and τn1. 
 
When comparing Figure 2 and Figure 1, it can be seen that σn causes a normal stressing 
(tensile or compressive), τnt causes a τ⊥⊥-stressing and τn1 a τ⊥||-stressing. 
One is obviously confronted now with the following situation: 
 
It is not possible to formulate a physically based fracture criterion using the stresses  
σσσσ2, σσσσ3, ττττ23, ττττ31, ττττ21 which are related to the normally used natural axes of the UD-
composite, because a brittle fracture hypothesis for the combined action of these stresses 
does not exist. 
 
According to Coulomb-Mohr, the brittle fracture criterion for IFF of UD-composites has to 
be formulated with the 3 stresses σn, τnt, τn1, which are acting on the fracture plane. (The 
given 5 stresses σ2, σ3, τ23, τ31, τ21 reduce to a set of only 3 stresses σn, τnt, τn1 which are 
relevant for IFF).

on the fracture plane which is perpendicular to the xn axis and inclined against the the thickness 
direction x3 by the ‘fracture angle’ θfp. 
 
5. Development of physically based fracture criteria and their application

conditions for fibre failure (FF) [Puc69a] are shown first.

From now on we shall concentrate solely on Puck’s theory for Interfibre Fracture (IFF).  
The 3 stresses σn, τnt, τn1 on the fracture plane which are relevant for brittle fracture, are 
proportional to the given 5 stresses σ2, σ3, τ23, τ31, τ21 according to the stress transformation in 
equation (2):

With the so called ‘Mohr-stresses’ σn(θfp), τnt(θfp), τn1(θfp) the following brittle-fracture-
conditions have been formulated by Puck [Puc96; Puc02; Kno07]. According to the IFF 
hypothesis only 2 different fracture conditions for IFF are required:

The constant c in equation (3a) controls the slope of the contour line of the body described 
by equation (3a) at the point, where it reaches the (τnt, τn1)-plane at σn = 0. 
Since the above IFF conditions are modified Coulomb-Mohr criteria, one has to be very 
careful when establishing the ‘strength’ values which have to be used in these fracture 
conditions.  
From the foregoing it is to conclude that global fracture criteria can be formulated with the 
stresses σ2, σ3, τ23, τ31, τ21 and the corresponding strengths

or tests with pure shear respectively.  
By contrast, IFF-criteria which are physically based on a modified Mohr-Coulomb 
hypothesis have to be formulated with ‘Mohr-stresses’ σn(θfp), τnt(θfp), τn1(θfp)  and ‘fracture 
resistances RA of the fibre-parallel action plane’. Corresponding to the 3 stressings σ⊥
t, τ⊥||, 
τ⊥⊥ which can, in the most general case, be involved in bringing about the IFF, 3 
corresponding ‘fracture resistances RA of the fibre-parallel action plane’ have to be used, 
namely:

(the superscript A means action plane). 
The following definition is valid: 
 
The fracture resistance of an action plane is the maximum resistance, with which the 
action plane can resist its own fracture caused by a uniaxial σσσσ⊥⊥⊥⊥
t -stressing or a pure ττττ⊥⊥⊥⊥⊥⊥⊥⊥-
stressing or ττττ⊥⊥⊥⊥||-stressing respectively. 
 
Important advice: The action plane fracture resistance 
A
R⊥⊥  must not be mixed up with the 
strength R⊥⊥ ! The value for 
A
R⊥⊥  can not be determined from a pure τ⊥⊥-test, instead 
A
R⊥⊥ must be calculated from the result of a transverse compression test [Puc02; Kno07]. The 
reason is given in Figure 1: If one deals with intrinsically brittle material a pure τ⊥⊥-stressing 
never produces a fracture in the action plane of τ⊥⊥, and therefore the measured strength (i.e. 
the transverse/transverse-shear load divided by the area of the plane in which the shear load is 
applied) would not deliver the value of 
A
R⊥⊥  but instead the transverse/transverse shear 
strength R⊥⊥ . 
With regard to a compressive stress σn, it is evident that the latter can certainly not produce 
a fracture in its own action plane, which would mean a separation of material in a plane which 
                                                
∗  In the literature on Puck’s fracture criteria some minor modifications of equation (3b) are to 
be found, which mainly serve for mathematical simplification. The above form of Equation 
(3b) is shown here because it demonstrates best the physical background of the strength 
increasing compressive stress σn.

is perpendicular to the direction of the acting compressive stress. In an abstract mathematical 
sense this could be expressed by 
c A
R⊥ = ∞ . In other words: We can forget 
c A
R⊥ . 
Very remarkable and favourable is the fact that the interfibre fracture behaviour of every 
arbitrary state of stress – may it be unidirectional or 5-dimensional – is governed by only one 
of the two equations, (3a) or (3b). Which one of the two equations has to be applied depends 
on the answer to the following question: Is σn a tensile stress, or is σn a compressive stress? It 
has been found that this discrimination is necessary, because tensile σn helps to produce 
fracture while compressive σn ‘makes the material stronger’. This last fact can easily be seen 
in the IFF equation (3b): Here the fracture producing shear stresses τnt, τn1 are in the 
numerator but the ‘strengthening’ stress σn appears in the denominator. The numerical value 
of a compressive σn is negative, therefore in the denominators of equation (3b) the amount of

  is positive and added to the intrinsic fracture resistances of the 
material

In order to calculate the magnitude of the fracture stresses at IFF the vector of the existing 
stresses σn(θfp), τnt(θfp), τn1(θfp) must be increased (stretched) by a stretch factor fS (see 
Appendix) in order to achieve fracture. Because of the linear relationship shown in equation 
(2) between the stresses σn(θfp), τnt(θfp), τn1(θfp) and the stresses σ2, σ3, τ23, τ31, τ21 the stretch 
factor fS found for σn(θfp), τnt(θfp), τn1(θfp) is also valid for the stresses σ2, σ3, τ23, τ31, τ21.  
 
6. The master fracture body 
The fracture body in (σn, τnt, τn1)-stress space described by the two IFF-equations (3a) and 
(3b) (one for tensile σn and one for compressive σn) is called the master-fracture body, it is 
shown in Figure 3. Its surface envelopes all (σn, τnt, τn1)-stress vectors which the UD-
composite material can withstand without fracture. Or in other words: The outer surface of the 
master fracture body consists of all points representing combinations of stresses σn, τnt, τn1  
(Figure 2) which by their combined action produce an interfibre fracture (IFF) of the UD-
composite.  
The problem which arises is the following: Until the ‘fracture angle’ θfp has not been 
determined, the direction of the fracture vector in (σn, τnt, τn1)-space, i.e. within the master 
fracture body, is also not known. How to find the fracture angle θfp? The key for solving this 
problem is the knowledge that the fracture will occur on the plane parallel to the fibres, on 
which the risk of fracture under the (σn, τnt, τn1)-stress combination under consideration has its 
maximum. Since the risk of fracture is proportional to the so called stress exposure ratio fE 
(see Appendix), the fracture plane is the one with the highest stress exposure fE due to the 
stress combination acting on the plane under consideration. Both a numerical and an 
analytical method for searching the fracture angle is well established and for instance also 
described in detail in the new guideline VDI 2014 Part 3 [VDI06]. 
 


 
 
Page 8 
 
Figure 3  The upper right part of the figure shows the master fracture body in (σn, τnt, τn1)-stress space. The 
master fracture body governs the strength against brittle interfibre fracture caused by any combination 
of stresses σ2, σ3, τ23, τ31, τ21. The master fracture body is open towards negative σn, because 
compressive σn cannot cause fracture of its action plane.  
As a well known example the fracture curve for combined action of σ2 and τ21 in the range from σ2 = 
R┴
t to σ2 = −R┴
c (= negative compressive strength) is shown on the surface of the master fracture 
body. In the lower left part of Figure 3, the usual presentation of a (σ2, τ21)-fracture curve in a (σ2, 
τ21)-plane can be found. 
The curve sections (a)  (b) are identical on the master fracture body and on the (σ2, τ21)-curve 
because the fracture angle is θfp = 0°. In this case σn = σ2 and τn1 = τ21 is valid while τnt = 0, see 
equation (2). The same applies to the curve section between (b) and (c). Surprisingly the stress σn on 
the fracture plane keeps a constant value between point (c) and point (d), that means in the whole 
range of ‘oblique fractures’ with  θfp ≠ 0°. At point (c) the fracture angle θfp is still 0°, from there to the 
point (d) it increases up to |θfp| = 50° to 55°. More about the highly interesting features of this figure 
can be found in the literature [Puc96; Puc98; Puc02; Kno07]. 
 
7. Fracture modes 
As soon as on this physical basis the (σn, τnt, τn1)-stress combination at IFF is found, we can 
also step back into the stress space of the given stresses i.e. into the (σ2, σ3, τ23, τ31, τ21)-stress 
space by means of the stretching factor fS (see Appendix). The result of this is graphically 
shown in Figure 3 on hand of the chosen example of a (σ2, τ21)-combination. 
Puck distinguishes between the different fracture modes, according to the stress 
combinations which appear on the detected fracture plane. 
In Figure 3 between points (a) and (b) we can see a Mode A, which corresponds to a 
combined action of tensile σn
t (which produces σ
┴
t) and τn1 (which produces 
||
τ ⊥ -stressing) on 
the fracture plane. 
Mode B between points (b) and (c) corresponds to a combined action of compressive σn
c 
(   
c
σ ⊥ ) and τn1 (   
||
τ ⊥ ). 
Mode C between points (c) and (d) is a most general case, that is a combination of 
compressive σn with τnt and τn1 on the fracture plane which corresponds to a combined 
(

σ c

A finding which is very important for practice is that in the section (c) to (d) of the (σ2, 
τ21)-curve, where inclined fracture planes occur, these can lead to disastrous splitting effects 
(‘wedge effect’) of the laminate. There are unique photographs of such oblique fractures 
which have caused a sudden total failure of a prototype tubular spring [Puc96; Puc02]. All 
these important findings are also addressed in VDI 2014 Part 3. 
Figure 4 shows an example of the resulting 3-dimensional fracture body for a (σ2, σ3, τ21)-
stress combination which has been found by means of the master fracture body in Figure 3. 
The marked sub-surfaces belong to the appearing fracture modes. Fracture bodies of this kind 
have very little similarity with the smooth ellipsoids which we know for instance from the 
Tsai-Wu failure criterion. 
 
 
Figure 4  A 3-dimensional fracture body for (σ2, σ3, τ21)-stress combination is shown [Puc96]. It is the final 
result of the calculation of all possible fracture stress combinations using the master fracture body, 
described by equations (3a) and (3b). The total surface of the (σ2, σ3, τ21)-fracture body is divided into 
sub-surfaces which are marked by (A), (B) and (C). These letters symbolize the different fracture 
modes which are to be expected. The symbol (A 0°) marks a surface where under a combination of σ2
t 
tension and τ21 shear, a fracture angle θfp = 0° appears. The area marked (A 90°) marks the region in 
which everywhere θfp = 90°, because the fracture is caused by tensile σ3 alone. There is no interaction 
between σ3 and τ21, because these two stresses do not act on a common action plane. 
 
The sharp corners and edges of the fracture body shown in Figure 4 are not to be expected 
in reality. They will certainly be ‘rounded’ due to effects of microdamage and probabilistic. A 
physically based method suitable for incorporating these effects into Puck’s fracture theory is 
explained in the extensive Appendix of [VDI06]. 
 
8. Advise on a calculation software 
A calculation software, which considers the non-linear behaviour of the lamina and the 
Puck theory of failure for the prediction of the strength of laminates as described in this paper 
is under development at the Department ‘Konstruktiver Leichtbau und Bauweisen (KLuB)’, 
headed by Prof. Schürmann, of Darmstadt Technical University. The program is named 
AlfaLam.nl, Advanced layerwise failure analysis of Laminates.nonlinear. The program is 
based on MS EXCEL and can be downloaded soon from the homepage of KLub

CONCLUSION 
Very realistic calculation results concerning deformation and strength of laminated FRP 
components can be achieved by the application of the Puck theory of failure in laminates, 
which basically distinguishes between IFF and FF in UD-composites. The theory as a whole 
has been significantly improved during the last decade by Puck’s development of the 
physically based ‘action plane related’ criteria for the IFF and is now comprehensively 
published in German and English in the new guideline VDI 2014 Part 3. The Puck theory of 
fracture in UD-composites is most probably the theory which is best verified by experiments. 
This is documented for instance in [Kno07].

Appendix: Stress exposure ratio and stretch factor 
Numerous algorithms in Puck’s action plane related fracture theory are based on the 
variable, which is called the stress exposure ratio or for short stress exposure. Its meaning is 
illustrated in Figure 5, again – as an example – a  (σ2, τ21)-stress is used for visualization. 
 
 
Figure 5  Illustration of the meaning of the stress exposure (ratio) using a (σ2, τ21)-stress combination. In 
general the vector { }
σ
 of the acting stresses is composed of (constant) residual stresses { }
σ r
 and 
(variable) load dependent stresses { }
σ L
.  
The stress exposure is defined as the length of the vector { }
σ  representing the acting stress 
combination divided by the length of the fracture vector { }fr
σ
, which has the same direction 
as { }

The stress exposure fE is a quantitative measure for the risk of fracture, because there is a 
linear relationship between fE and the acting stresses. If the stress exposure becomes fE = 1, 
the fracture stress is reached. For instance, calculating fE = 1 for a (σn, τnt, τn1)-stress state 
means, that the vector (σn, τnt, τn1) just gets in contact with the surface of the fracture master 
body. 
The reciprocal of the stress exposure fE is the so called stretch factor fS:

The stress exposure fE is absolutely essential when searching for the fracture plane. The 
fracture plane is simply the action plane with the highest risk of fracture, i.e. with the highest 
stress exposure fE calculated by taking into account all stresses of the action plane, resulting 
from residual and load dependent stresses. In practice the fracture plane can be found by 
solving the following extremum problem: the angle θ = θfp has to be found for which

is fulfilled. 
 
Remark: Fracture conditions are very often written as functions F of the acting stresses 
containing first and second order terms. It would lead to a wrong result when setting 
dF dθ = 0
 for searching the fracture plane. In this case the stress exposure fE has to be 
calculated from the following equation (7) before applying the equations (6a) and (6b). 
With ΣL as the sum of the linear terms and ΣQ as the sum of the quadratic terms fE follows 
from:

Experience shows that the stress exposure fE is a very versatile and easy to use tool for the 
description of different fracture states both due to IFF and FF. In Puck’s lamina-by-lamina 
fracture theory, the stress exposure fE after IFF is for instance used as the variable which 
governs the stiffness degradation of the laminate caused by the increasing number of IFF 
cracks in the lamina. In this case fE is the only variable which allows to mathematically 
express the physically based combined action of several stresses, such as σ1, σ2, τ21. This is 
explained in more detail in [Puc98; Puc02; Kno07; VDI06]. 
In a recent paper [Puc07], Puck makes use of the stress exposure fE for establishing a 
physically-based model for the mathematical treatment of the non-linear (σ2
c, ε2)- and (τ21, 
γ21)-stress/strain behaviour of UD-composites before IFF, which is assumed to be caused by 
micro damage. The idea is to take the stress exposure as a measure for the micro damage due 
to σ⊥
c - and τ⊥||-stressings and their interactions. This makes it possible to treat the interaction 
of τ21 on the strain ε2 and of σ2
c on the shear strain γ12 analytically.
